: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the designing,developing,testing and maintenance of software applications.
it is used to find solutions to tecnological problems for example if a mobile app for transferring funds has a glitch a software developer can rectify the issue
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
use of programming languages such as python
use of artifical intelligence such as gemini
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning
requirements
design and prototype
software development
testing
deployment
maintenance
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
in agile customer feedback is taken into consideration whereas in waterfall it isnt. 
in waterfall once a step is copleted that is it whereas in agile you can review your steps
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer creates the software product through coding
quality assuarance engineer documents software defects
project manager is in charge of the development,organization and delivery of the project
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
in ides programmers develop software code efficiently
in vcs developers track changes to their code
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is giving a set of specific instructions to ai models in order to get solutions

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
give solutions to pandemics
give solutions to the ongoing covid 19 health pandemic
it has specified that it is a health pandemic
